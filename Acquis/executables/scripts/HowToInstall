There is an infinity of ways to organize the files related to the Acquisition System, SAMBA. But, if you are a beginner, the best is to adopt the "standard" installation in the following way ยน:
1/ download the Samba Pack dedicated to spheres: Pack_SPC.tar;
2/ under a shell (e.g. with Terminal), create a folder, preferably just in your top directory, preferably called "Samba" or "Acquis";
3/ "cd" to it;
4/ move the Samba Pack inside ("mv <my_downloads_folder>/Pack_SPC.tar .");
5/ untar it ("tar xvf Pack_SPC.tar");
6/ install stuff with the standard script: "./executables/scripts/install_std";
7/ get executables accessible from shell: "cp ./executables/scripts/tcsh_login ../.login"
   (by the way, set /bin/tcsh as the default login shell for Terminal)
8/ Icons appeared in your Dock. Click on "StartSamba" and you will see Samba starting, with an emulation of the detector.

To go further, you have in turn to prepare your computer to accept the connections from the ADC box. This will be described in a document to be completed at the moment...

Other files to download:
* FormatSambaV3.pdf : Format of the run files produced by Samba.
* libarch.tar : A library to read Samba runs, and an example of using it.
