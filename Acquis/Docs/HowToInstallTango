1.- Installation of TANGO when SAMBA is not yet installed
=============================================================

1.1) choose a directory to keep the application and "cd" to there;
- recommended: $HOME/bin (if it exists).

1.2) put inside the appli Tango.app (which from the Linux point of view, is actually a directory)

variant 1.2.a) if this bundle is sent as a tarfile (like tango.tar):
- just unpack the packet with "tar xvf tango.tar".

1.3) better to define an alias in your .profile or .tcshrc, e.g.:
- "alias tango <the_appli_location_see_above>/Tango.app/Contents/MacOS/Tango"

... assuming that this <the_appli_location> here is the full path where you put Tango (enter "pwd" from this location, to get this full path).

2.- Using Tango with this installation
======================================

2.1) "cd" to the location where you have your runs

e.g. if all the directories like "vd08q000" are in "/Users/myself/NEWSG/SambaRuns/",
first do "cd /Users/myself/NEWSG/SambaRuns/".

2.2) enter "tango <run_name>" (assuming that here "tango" is the alias as defined in 1.3).

You should always launch tango from this location.
